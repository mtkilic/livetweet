# livetweet
Live tweets from Twitter with Twitter API.

You can pull any live tweets by "key" word or username. After pulling tweets you can save as csv file and do
Data Analytics on top of tweets.

I am looking to add sentiment analysis on the tweets that I pulled. Everyone is welcome to contribute !
